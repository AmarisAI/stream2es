# stream2es

Standalone utility to stream different inputs into Elasticsearch.

## Read This First

*If you've just wandered here, first check out [Logstash](http://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash).  It's a much more general tool, and one of our featured products.  If for some reason it doesn't do something that's important to you, create an issue there.  stream2es is mostly a quick hack to ingest a bit of data so you can get working with ES.  We will fix bugs as we have time.*

## Install

You'll need Java 7.  Run `java -version` to make sure.

Then download `stream2es`:

    % curl -O download.elasticsearch.org/stream2es/stream2es; chmod +x stream2es

# Usage

## stdin

By default, `stream2es` reads JSON documents from stdin.

    % echo '{"field":1}' | stream2es
    create index http://localhost:9200/foo
    stream stdin
    flushing index queue
    00:00.505 2.0d/s 0.1K/s 1 1 70
    streamed 1 docs 1 bytes xfer 70
    %

## Generator

`stream2es` can fuzz data for you.  It can create blank documents, or documents with integer fields, or documents with string fields if you supply a dictionary.

Blank documents are easy:

```
stream2es generator
```

Ints need to know how big you want them.  This template would give you a single field with values between `0` and `127`, inclusive.

```
stream2es generator --fields "f1:int:128"
```

To add a string, we need to add a template for it, and a file of newline-separated lines of text.  Given a field template of "NAME:str:N`stream2es` will select `N` number of words from each dictionary:

```
# zsh
% stream2es generator --fields "f1:int:128,f2:str:2" --dictionary <(echo foo\\nbar\\nbaz)
# any shell
% cat <<EOF >/tmp/dict
foo
bar
baz
EOF
% stream2es generator --fields "f1:int:128,f2:str:2" --dictionary /tmp/dict --max-docs 5
create index http://localhost:9200/foo
stream generator to http://localhost:9200/foo/t
flushing index queue
00:00.279 17.9d/s 1.1K/s 5 5 305 0
streamed 5 indexed 5 bytes xfer 305 errors 0
done
% curl localhost:9200/foo/_search\?format=yaml | fgrep -A2 _source
    _source:
      f1: 28
      f2: "foo baz"
--
    _source:
      f1: 88
      f2: "baz foo"
--
    _source:
      f1: 26
      f2: "baz baz"
--
    _source:
      f1: 68
      f2: "bar baz"
--
    _source:
      f1: 64
      f2: "foo foo"
%
```

Fortunately, most *nix systems come with `/usr/share/dict/words`, which is a great choice if you just need some English text.  Linux distributions also have other packages you can install.


## Wikipedia

Index the latest Wikipedia article dump.

    % stream2es wiki --target http://localhost:9200/tmp
    create index http://localhost:9200/tmp
    stream wiki from http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-art
    icles.xml.bz2
    00:04.984 44.7d/s 622.7K/s 223 223 3177989 0 10
    00:07.448 54.1d/s 838.1K/s 403 180 3213889 0 794
    00:09.715 63.0d/s 961.4K/s 612 209 3172256 0 1081
    00:12.000 73.2d/s 1036.1K/s 878 266 3167860 0 1404
    00:14.385 75.2d/s 1079.9K/s 1082 204 3174907 0 1756
    ^Cstreamed 1158 docs 1082 bytes xfer 15906901 errors 0

What is the output telling me?

    00:12.000: MM:SS that the app has been running
      73.2d/s: Docs per second indexed
    1036.1K/s: Bytes per second indexed (bulk transferred over the wire)
          878: Total docs indexed so far
          266: Docs in bulk
      3167860: Total JSON bytes of docs in the bulk
            0: Total docs that have had indexing errors so far
         1404: The _id of the first doc in the bulk

If you're at a caf√© or want to use a local copy of the dump, supply `--source`:

    % ./stream2es wiki --max-docs 5 --source /d/data/enwiki-20121201-pages-articles.xml.bz2

## Elasticsearch

If you use the `es` stream, you can copy indices from one Elasticsearch to another.  Example:

    % stream2es es \
         --source http://foo.local:9200/wiki \
         --target http://bar.local:9200/wiki2

This is a convenient way to reindex data if you need to change the number of shards or update your mapping.

## Twitter

In order to stream Twitter, you have to create an app and authorize it.

### Create app

Visit (https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new) and create an app.  Call it `stream2es`.  Note the `Consumer key` and `Consumer secret`.

### Authorize app

Now run `stream2es twitter --authorize --key CONSUMER_KEY --secret CONSUMER_SECRET` and complete the dialog.

### Run with new creds

You should now be able to stream twitter with simply `stream2es twitter`.  stream2es will grab the most recent cached credentials from `~/.authinfo.stream2es`.

### Tracking keywords

By default, stream2es will stream random sample of all public tweets, however
you can configure stream2es to _track_ specific keywords as follows:

    	stream2es twitter --track "Linux%%New York%%March Madness"

# Options

    % stream2es --help
    Copyright 2013 Elasticsearch

    Usage: stream2es [CMD] [OPTS]

    ..........


You can change index settings by supplying `--settings`:

    % echo '{"name":"alfredo"}' | ./stream2es stdin --settings '
    {
        "settings": {
            "refresh_interval": "2m"
        }
    }'

# Contributing

stream2es is written in Clojure.  You'll need leiningen 2.0+ to build.

    % lein bin
    % target/stream2es

You'll also need this little git alias if you want to do `make`:

```
[alias]
ver = "!git log --pretty=format:'%ai %h' -1 | perl -pe 's,(\\d\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d) (\\d\\d):(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d) [^ ]+ ([a-z0-9]+),\\1\\2\\3\\7,'"
```
